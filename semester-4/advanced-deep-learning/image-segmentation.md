# 🧠 **Image Segmentation – Detailed Notes**

---

## 📌 1. **Object Detection vs Segmentation**

| Feature | **Object Detection** | **Image Segmentation** |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Goal** | Identify objects and draw bounding boxes | Classify each pixel into a category |
| **Output** | Bounding box + class label | Pixel-wise classification |
| **Precision** | Coarse | Fine-grained |
| **Use Case** | Face detection, pedestrian detection | Medical imaging, self-driving cars |

### Example:
- Object Detection: "There’s a cat at (x, y, width, height)."
- Segmentation: "These pixels belong to a cat."

## 📌 2. **Semantic Segmentation vs Instance Segmentation**

| Feature | **Semantic Segmentation** | **Instance Segmentation** |
|---------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| **What** | Assigns class to each pixel | Separates individual objects of the same class |
| **Example** | All dogs are "dog" | Dog #1, Dog #2, etc. |
| **Complexity** | Simpler | More complex |
| **Models** | U-Net, DeepLab | Mask R-CNN |

---

## 📌 3. **U-Net Model – Architecture and Working**

### ✅ **Purpose**:
Developed for **biomedical image segmentation** – precise localization with fewer training images.

### ✅ **Structure**:
U-shaped architecture with:
- **Encoder (Contracting path)**: Captures context using convolution + pooling.
- **Decoder (Expanding path)**: Restores spatial info using upsampling + concatenation.

### 🧱 **Workflow**:
1. Input → Convolutions + Pooling (downsampling).
2. Bottleneck layer (bridge between encoder-decoder).
3. Decoder upsamples + concatenates features from encoder (skip connections).
4. Final layer: 1x1 Conv to get per-pixel class scores.

## 📌 4. **Encoder and Decoder Architecture**

### 🎯 **Encoder (Downsampling)**:
- Series of **Conv → ReLU → MaxPooling** blocks.
- Each step: spatial size ↓, feature depth ↑.
- Captures **what** is in the image (semantics).

### 🎯 **Decoder (Upsampling)**:
- Series of **Up-conv (transposed conv)** + skip connections from encoder.
- Each step: spatial size ↑, detail is recovered.
- Refines **where** objects are.

### ➕ **Skip Connections**:
- Help retain **fine-grained spatial details**.
- Combines **low-level (edges)** and **high-level (context)** features.

## 📌 5. **U-Net vs Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs)**

| Feature | **U-Net** | **FCN** |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Architecture** | Symmetric encoder-decoder with skip connections | Encoder + decoder with interpolation |
| **Skip Connections** | Explicit concatenation | Few or only feature fusion |
| **Performance** | Stronger for medical and small-object tasks | More general-purpose |
| **Design** | Focused on localization | More general segmentation |
| **Result Quality** | Preserves spatial details | Coarser boundaries |

---

## 📌 6. **Mask R-CNN – Architecture and Limitations**

### ✅ **Architecture**:
An extension of **Faster R-CNN** for **instance segmentation**.

### 🧱 **Main Steps**:
1. **Backbone CNN**: Feature extraction (e.g., ResNet + FPN).
2. **Region Proposal Network (RPN)**: Proposes candidate object regions.
3. **RoI Align**: Aligns proposals to fixed size (better than RoI Pool).
4. **Head Networks**:
   - Class label prediction
   - Bounding box regression
   - Binary mask prediction (pixel-wise segmentation)

### 🔴 **Limitations**:
- Computationally expensive
- Slower inference speed
- Complex training pipeline
- Limited scalability for very small or large objects

## 📌 7. **Metrics and Losses for Segmentation Algorithms**

### 📏 **Metrics**:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **IoU (Intersection over Union)** | Ratio of overlap between predicted and true mask |
| **Dice Coefficient** | 2× overlap / (sum of areas) – balances FP/FN |
| **Pixel Accuracy** | % of correctly classified pixels |
| **Mean IoU** | Average IoU over all classes |

### 🧨 **Loss Functions**:

---

### ✅ **When to Use What**:
- Use **Cross-Entropy** for general segmentation.
- Use **Dice/IoU Loss** for medical/sparse object segmentation.
- Use **Focal Loss** when data is highly imbalanced.

## 🧠 Summary Table

| Topic | Key Point |
|-------|-----------|
| Object Detection vs Segmentation | Detection: bbox, Segmentation: pixel-level |
| Semantic vs Instance | Semantic = class only, Instance = object-wise |
| U-Net | Encoder-decoder with skip connections |
| Encoder/Decoder | Downsample to extract features, Upsample to restore detail |
| U-Net vs FCN | U-Net = better localization, FCN = general purpose |
| Mask R-CNN | Detection + Segmentation, but heavy |
| Metrics/Losses | IoU, Dice, CE, Focal – depend on context and dataset |
