# **Unit 4: MongoDB, PyMongo, Spark & Spark SQL**

## 2 Marks
### **Q1. How Document is represented in MongoDB?**
- A document in MongoDB is a **JSON-like structure** called **BSON** (Binary JSON).
- Example:
  ```json
  {
    "_id": 1,
    "name": "Caine",
    "age": 30,
    "skills": ["Music", "Coding"]
  }
  ```
- It's schema-less and supports nested documents.
---

### **Q2. How to add a single data in MongoDB?**
- Use the `insertOne()` method.
- Example in Mongo shell:
  ```js
  db.users.insertOne({ name: "Caine", age: 30 });
  ```
- In PyMongo:
  ```python
  db.users.insert_one({"name": "Caine", "age": 30})
  ```
---

### **Q3. Define RDD in Spark**

- **Characteristics**:
  - Collections have **no fixed schema**.
  - Documents in a collection may have different fields and data types.
  - There is **no limit to the number of documents** in a collection.
- **Naming**:
  - A collection name must be a **string** and can contain lowercase and special characters, but cannot contain **null or spaces**.
  

#### ðŸ”¹ **Exploring Documents in MongoDB**
- **Document**: A document is a **data record** in MongoDB and is represented in **BSON (Binary JSON)** format.
- **Structure**:
  - A document is essentially a **JSON object**.
  - A document consists of **field-value pairs** where the field is a **key** and the value can be a variety of data types (string, integer, array, sub-document).
  - Every document has an implicit **_id** field that is a unique identifier (can be custom or autogenerated).
  
  Example Document:
  ```json
  {
    "_id": 1,
    "name": "Caine",
    "age": 30,
    "skills": ["Music", "Coding"],
    "address": {
      "street": "123 Main St",
      "city": "New York"
    }
  }
  ```

#### ðŸ”¹ **How Collections and Documents Work Together**
- A **collection** holds **documents**.
- **Documents** within the collection can have different structures (schemas) but generally share similar characteristics or data.
- MongoDB uses **indexes** to improve search performance in collections.


#### ðŸ”¹ **MongoDB Data Flow (Overview)**
1. **Data is inserted into collections**.
2. **Documents** are stored in **collections**, which can be queried, updated, and deleted.
3. **Aggregation** operations can be performed on documents within collections to analyze data.

### Q2. What is meant by NoSQL? Explain in detail about CRUD operations in MongoDB.
#### **What is meant by NoSQL?**

- **NoSQL** stands for **Not Only SQL**, meaning it refers to **non-relational databases**.
- Unlike traditional **relational databases (RDBMS)**, which use structured data and tables with fixed schemas, **NoSQL** databases are designed to handle **unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data**.
- They are highly **scalable**, **flexible**, and support **varied data models** like key-value, document, graph, or column-family.

#### **Key Characteristics of NoSQL Databases**:
1. **Schema-less**: Data can be stored without predefined schemas. Each record (document) can have a different structure.
2. **Scalability**: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, which makes them efficient at handling large volumes of data.
3. **High Availability**: They ensure **high availability** with **replication** and **distributed architecture**.
4. **Flexible Data Models**: Can store data in various formats, including JSON, XML, or key-value pairs.
5. **Eventual Consistency**: Many NoSQL databases prioritize availability and partition tolerance over consistency (according to the CAP theorem).

#### **Types of NoSQL Databases**:
1. **Document Store**: Stores data as **documents** (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB).
2. **Key-Value Store**: Stores data as key-value pairs (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB).
3. **Column-Family Store**: Organizes data into columns rather than rows (e.g., Cassandra, HBase).
4. **Graph Database**: Stores data in nodes, edges, and properties (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune).

#### âœ… **CRUD Operations in MongoDB**

CRUD stands for **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete**. These operations are essential for interacting with MongoDB and are supported by its drivers, including MongoDB Shell and PyMongo.

##### **1. Create Operation** (`insertOne()`, `insertMany()`)
- **Purpose**: Insert new documents into a collection.
  
- **Example**:
  - Insert **a single document**:
    ```js
    db.users.insertOne({
      "name": "Caine",
      "age": 30,
      "skills": ["Music", "Coding"]
    });
    ```

  - Insert **multiple documents**:
    ```js
    db.users.insertMany([
      { "name": "Mevan", "age": 8, "skills": ["Art"] },
      { "name": "Zara", "age": 25, "skills": ["Design"] }
    ]);
    ```
---
##### **2. Read Operation** (`find()`, `findOne()`)
- **Purpose**: Retrieve documents from a collection.
  
- **Example**:
  - **Find all documents** in a collection:
    ```js
    db.users.find();
    ```

  - **Find specific documents** (filter by `age`):
    ```js
    db.users.find({ "age": { $gt: 20 } });
    ```

  - **Find a single document**:
    ```js
    db.users.findOne({ "name": "Caine" });
    ```

##### **3. Update Operation** (`updateOne()`, `updateMany()`, `replaceOne()`)
- **Purpose**: Modify existing documents in the collection.

- **Example**:
  - **Update one document**:
    ```js
    db.users.updateOne(
      { "name": "Caine" }, 
      { $set: { "age": 31 } }
    );
    ```

  - **Update multiple documents**:
    ```js
    db.users.updateMany(
      { "age": { $lt: 25 } },
      { $set: { "status": "young" } }
    );
    ```

  - **Replace a document**:
    ```js
    db.users.replaceOne(
      { "name": "Mevan" },
      { "name": "Mevan", "age": 9, "skills": ["Drawing"] }
    );
    ```


##### **4. Delete Operation** (`deleteOne()`, `deleteMany()`)
- **Purpose**: Remove documents from a collection.

- **Example**:
  - **Delete a single document**:
    ```js
    db.users.deleteOne({ "name": "Caine" });
    ```

  - **Delete multiple documents**:
    ```js
    db.users.deleteMany({ "age": { $lt: 20 } });
    ```


#### **Additional Notes on CRUD Operations**:
- MongoDBâ€™s operations support **filters** and **operators** to specify conditions, such as `$gt`, `$lt`, `$eq`, `$ne`, etc.
- **Indexes** can be created for optimizing search performance during CRUD operations.
- **Atomicity**: Operations like `updateOne()` and `insertOne()` are atomic, meaning they are guaranteed to complete successfully, or not at all.

### Q3. Elaborate in detail about spark architecture with appropriate diagrams?

Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for big data processing, with built-in modules for streaming, SQL, machine learning, and graph processing. Its architecture is designed to provide speed, ease of use, and the ability to handle a variety of data sources and formats. Below is a detailed explanation of the **Spark architecture** with its components and flow.

#### **Key Components of Spark Architecture**

1. **Driver Program**:
   - The **Driver** is the entry point for any Spark application. It manages the overall control and coordinates the work of **executors**.
   - It runs the **main()** function, responsible for creating the **SparkContext**, and coordinates the parallel execution of tasks.
   - The Driver interacts with the **Cluster Manager** to allocate resources and controls the **job scheduling**.

2. **Cluster Manager**:
   - **Cluster Manager** is responsible for managing resources in a cluster, including allocating and deallocating resources.
   - Spark supports various cluster managers like:
     - **Standalone**: Spark's own cluster manager.
     - **YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)**: A resource manager for Hadoop ecosystems.
     - **Mesos**: A distributed systems kernel.
   - The **Cluster Manager** negotiates resources with the **Driver** and assigns tasks to **executors**.

3. **Executors**:
   - Executors are the **worker nodes** in a Spark cluster that run tasks assigned by the **Driver**.
   - Each executor runs in its own Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and multiple tasks can be run in parallel within the executor.
   - Executors are responsible for **storing data** in memory (using Spark's Resilient Distributed Datasets or RDDs) and **computing the results** of tasks.
   - They persist data and shuffle data between stages.
   - An executor exists for the entire lifetime of a Spark application.

4. **Worker Nodes**:
   - Worker nodes are the physical machines that run the **executors**.
   - These nodes are part of the cluster and communicate with the **Driver** to get tasks from the **Cluster Manager**.

5. **Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)**:
   - RDDs are the fundamental data structure of Spark. They represent a **distributed collection of objects** that can be processed in parallel.
   - They are immutable and fault-tolerant, meaning they can handle failures by recomputing lost data from the lineage.
   - Operations on RDDs are either **narrow** (like `map()`, `filter()`) or **wide** (like `groupBy()`, `reduceByKey()`).

6. **Stages** and **Tasks**:
   - Spark divides work into **stages** based on **wide transformations** (those that require data shuffling, e.g., `groupBy()`, `reduceByKey()`).
   - Each stage is split into multiple **tasks**, which are distributed across the **executors**.
   - A task is the smallest unit of work and corresponds to one **partition** of the data.
   

#### **Execution Flow in Spark**

1. **Application Submission**:
   - The **user** submits a Spark application (through the `spark-submit` command).
   - The application contains the **Driver** program with tasks and transformations.

2. **Job Scheduling**:
   - The **Driver** requests the **Cluster Manager** for resources.
   - The **Cluster Manager** allocates resources and launches **executors**.
   - The **Driver** divides the application into jobs, and jobs into stages based on transformations.

3. **Task Execution**:
   - **Stages** are divided into **tasks**, each corresponding to a partition of the data.
   - Tasks are scheduled to be executed on **executors** by the **Driver**.

4. **Data Shuffling**:
   - In **wide transformations**, Spark performs **shuffling** to redistribute data across partitions.
   - Shuffling happens between **executors**, which can cause significant network overhead.

5. **Completion**:
   - Once all tasks are complete, the **executors** send the results back to the **Driver**.
   - The **Driver** completes the application, and the final output is displayed or saved to external storage.

   - **OneHotEncoder**: Convert indexed labels into one-hot encoded vectors.
     ```python
     encoder = OneHotEncoder(inputCol="categoryIndex", outputCol="categoryVec")
     ```
   - **VectorAssembler**: Combine all feature columns into a single feature vector for model training.
     ```python
     assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=["feature1", "feature2", "categoryVec"], outputCol="features")
     ```

5. **Step 5: Select the Model Algorithm**
   - Choose a machine learning model for your task (classification, regression, etc.). For example, a **Logistic Regression** model for classification:
     ```python
     lr = LogisticRegression(featuresCol="features", labelCol="label")
     ```

6. **Step 6: Build the Pipeline**
   - A **Pipeline** is a way to chain all the transformations and model training steps together. It ensures that every step is applied in the right sequence. The pipeline consists of transformers and estimators.
     ```python
     pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[indexer, encoder, assembler, lr])
     ```

7. **Step 7: Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets**
   - Split the data into training and testing datasets (commonly 80%-20% split).
     ```python
     train_data, test_data = data.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2], seed=1234)
     ```

8. **Step 8: Train the Model**
   - Fit the pipeline to the training data. This will run all the transformations (indexing, encoding, assembling) and train the model.
     ```python
     model = pipeline.fit(train_data)
     ```

9. **Step 9: Make Predictions**
   - Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data.
     ```python
     predictions = model.transform(test_data)
     ```

10. **Step 10: Evaluate the Model**
    - Use evaluation metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, or **F1 score** for classification tasks. For example, using **BinaryClassificationEvaluator** for binary classification:
      ```python
      evaluator = BinaryClassificationEvaluator(labelCol="label", rawPredictionCol="prediction")
      accuracy = evaluator.evaluate(predictions)
      print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
      ```

11. **Step 11: Model Tuning (Optional)**
    - For improving the modelâ€™s performance, hyperparameter tuning can be done using techniques such as **Grid Search** or **Random Search**.
    - Example: Using **ParamGridBuilder** for hyperparameter tuning:
      ```python
      from pyspark.ml.tuning import ParamGridBuilder, CrossValidator
      paramGrid = (ParamGridBuilder()
                   .addGrid(lr.regParam, [0.1, 0.01])
                   .addGrid(lr.maxIter, [10, 20])
                   .build())
      crossval = CrossValidator(estimator=pipeline, estimatorParamMaps=paramGrid, evaluator=evaluator, numFolds=3)
      cvModel = crossval.fit(train_data)
      ```

12. **Step 12: Save and Load the Model (Optional)**
    - After training, you may want to save the model for future use.
      ```python
      model.save("path_to_save_model")
      # To load the model
      loaded_model = PipelineModel.load("path_to_save_model")
      ```

### Q5. Explain in detail about Hyper parameter training and AutoML in pyspark.
#### **Hyperparameter Training and AutoML in PySpark**

Hyperparameter tuning and AutoML are crucial aspects of the machine learning workflow that aim to improve the performance of a model by optimizing its hyperparameters and automating the process of model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

In **PySpark**, hyperparameter tuning is typically done using **Grid Search** or **Random Search**, while **AutoML** is a broader concept that automates various stages of the machine learning pipeline.

#### **1. Hyperparameter Training (Tuning) in PySpark**

##### **What are Hyperparameters?**
- **Hyperparameters** are parameters that are set before the model training process begins. These are external to the model and are typically set manually.
- Examples of hyperparameters include:
  - **Learning rate** (for gradient-based models)
  - **Regularization parameter** (for logistic regression)
  - **Number of trees** (for random forest models)
  - **Max depth** (for decision trees)
  - **Batch size** (for neural networks)

##### **Importance of Hyperparameter Tuning:**
- **Hyperparameter tuning** can significantly improve the modelâ€™s performance. Instead of relying on default values, finding the optimal hyperparameters helps to:
  - Prevent **underfitting** or **overfitting**.
  - Improve the **accuracy** of the model.
  - Ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

##### **Methods of Hyperparameter Tuning:**
1. **Grid Search:**
   - A **Grid Search** explores a manually specified subset of the hyperparameter space. It performs an exhaustive search over all combinations of a given set of hyperparameters.
   - **Example**: If you are tuning a Random Forest, you can define a grid for the number of trees and max depth:
     ```python
     from pyspark.ml.tuning import ParamGridBuilder
     from pyspark.ml.evaluation import RegressionEvaluator
     from pyspark.ml.tuning import CrossValidator

     paramGrid = (ParamGridBuilder()
                  .addGrid(rf.numTrees, [10, 20, 30])
                  .addGrid(rf.maxDepth, [5, 10, 15])
                  .build())
     ```

2. **Random Search:**
   - Unlike Grid Search, **Random Search** samples the hyperparameter space randomly. This can be more efficient when the number of possible hyperparameter combinations is very large.

3. **Cross-Validation:**
   - **Cross-validation** is a technique used in conjunction with hyperparameter tuning to evaluate the model's performance. It divides the dataset into multiple subsets (folds) and trains the model on different subsets while evaluating on the others.
   - It helps prevent overfitting and provides a more accurate evaluation of the model's performance.

##### **Example: Hyperparameter Tuning with Grid Search and Cross-Validation**
```python
from pyspark.ml.classification import RandomForestClassifier
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import BinaryClassificationEvaluator
from pyspark.ml.tuning import CrossValidator, ParamGridBuilder

# Initialize RandomForest Classifier
rf = RandomForestClassifier(labelCol="label", featuresCol="features")

# Create the parameter grid
paramGrid = (ParamGridBuilder()
             .addGrid(rf.numTrees, [10, 20])
             .addGrid(rf.maxDepth, [5, 10])
             .build())

# CrossValidator for hyperparameter tuning
evaluator = BinaryClassificationEvaluator(labelCol="label")
crossval = CrossValidator(estimator=rf,
                          estimatorParamMaps=paramGrid,
                          evaluator=evaluator,
                          numFolds=3)

# Fit the model using cross-validation
cvModel = crossval.fit(trainingData)
```

#### **2. AutoML in PySpark**

##### **What is AutoML?**
- **AutoML (Automated Machine Learning)** refers to the automation of the end-to-end process of applying machine learning to real-world problems.
- It encompasses:
  - **Data preprocessing** (cleaning, normalization, transformation).
  - **Model selection** (choosing the appropriate algorithm).
  - **Hyperparameter tuning** (finding optimal hyperparameters).
  - **Model evaluation** (performance metrics like accuracy, precision, etc.).
  - **Model deployment** (deploying the best model for production).

##### **Why is AutoML Important?**
- It simplifies the process of building machine learning models, making it more accessible for non-experts.
- It helps save time by automating repetitive tasks such as model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
- It ensures that machine learning models are optimized and performant.

##### **AutoML in PySpark:**
- PySpark does not have a dedicated AutoML library, but various tools and techniques can be combined to achieve similar functionality:
  - **Spark MLlib** provides basic machine learning algorithms and tools.
  - **MLflow** is a great tool for tracking experiments and automating model workflows.
  - **H2O.ai** and **TPOT** are third-party libraries for AutoML that can be integrated with PySpark for advanced AutoML capabilities.

##### **AutoML with H2O.ai:**
- **H2O.ai** offers a framework that supports AutoML. It automates the process of:
  - Model selection (e.g., decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting).
  - Hyperparameter tuning.
  - Model evaluation and validation.
  
- Example of H2O AutoML:
  ```python
  import h2o
  from h2o.automl import H2OAutoML

  # Start H2O cluster
  h2o.init()

  # Load the dataset
  data = h2o.import_file("data.csv")

  # Split the data into training and test sets
  train, test = data.split_frame(ratios=[.8])

  # Initialize AutoML and run it
  aml = H2OAutoML(max_models=20, seed=1)
  aml.train(y="target", training_frame=train)

  # View the leaderboard of models
  lb = aml.leaderboard
  print(lb)
  ```

##### **AutoML with MLflow:**
- **MLflow** provides an end-to-end platform for managing the machine learning lifecycle, including tracking experiments, running hyperparameter tuning, and deploying models.
- MLflow can be used to automate hyperparameter tuning, model tracking, and even deployment.
  ```python
  import mlflow
  from mlflow import spark

  # Track an experiment with MLflow
  with mlflow.start_run():
      mlflow.log_param("numTrees", 10)
      mlflow.log_param("maxDepth", 5)
      # Train the model here and log metrics
      mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy)
  ```

#### **Steps in AutoML:**
1. **Data Loading**: Automatically load and preprocess the data (e.g., handling missing values, feature engineering).
2. **Model Selection**: Automatically choose the best model based on the data type and problem (e.g., regression, classification).
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Automatically tune the hyperparameters of the selected model.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models using cross-validation and relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision).
5. **Model Deployment**: Automatically deploy the best model for real-time predictions or batch predictions.

#### **Summary:**

- **Hyperparameter Tuning** in PySpark helps improve model performance by adjusting parameters like `learning rate`, `num trees`, etc., and can be achieved using **Grid Search** and **Random Search** combined with **Cross-Validation**.
- **AutoML** aims to automate the entire machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment, saving time and effort.
- **PySpark**, combined with tools like **MLlib**, **MLflow**, and **H2O.ai**, provides a framework for automating machine learning tasks. **MLflow** is specifically useful for experiment tracking, while **H2O.ai** can be used for advanced AutoML in large-scale data processing scenarios.

This makes the machine learning process more efficient, accessible, and less error-prone, even for users with limited expertise in machine learning.
